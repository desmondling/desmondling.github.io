									<h3>Education</h3>
									<p>BACHELOR OF AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING WITH HONOURS<br />
									(COLLABORATION PROGRAMME WITH HKA, GERMANY) <br />
									2020-2024</p>
								</header>
								<p>“Graduated from a dual degree programme offered by University Malaysia Pahang al-Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA) and the University of Applied Sciences (HKA), Germany, this unique programme provided me with a comprehensive understanding of automotive engineering principles, enriched by the high academic standards of German professors from HKA. The class was delivered by lecturers from both UMPSA and HKA, offering a diverse and international perspective on automotive engineering. A significant part of this programme was the requirement to achieve proficiency in the German language up to the B1 level. I successfully graduated with dual degrees from UMPSA and HKA, demonstrating my commitment, adaptability, and academic capability.”</p>
								<header class="major">
									<p>DIPLOMA IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING <br />
									2017-2019</p>
								</header>
								<p>“Graduated from Diploma in Mechanical Engineering program from Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP). This program has provided me with a robust foundation in various engineering fields, including mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and materials science. One of the highlights of my academic journey was a 6-month internship during my final semester. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge I gained from my coursework to real-world engineering problems. It also provided me with valuable insights into the workings of the mechanical engineering industry and helped me develop practical skills that are crucial in the field.”</p>
